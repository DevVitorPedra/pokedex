        <p>This application was developed with educational purpose!
        </p>
        <p>It is my first ReactJS application,</p>
        <p>the main idea was to create a pokedex based on the
        Pokemon Emerald/Gameboy Advance colors and fonts.</p>
       
        <p><strong>Hope you enjoy it!</strong></p>
